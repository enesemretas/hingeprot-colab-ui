-- README FILE FOR HINGEPROT'S STANDALONE VERSION

HingeProt: An Algorithm For Protein Hinge Prediction Using Elastic Network Models

In this readme file, you will find the instructions to run the standalone version
of HingeProt, and the explanations of the outputs.

The program does not require installation, it comes as a package,
consisting of 5 executable programs and one perl script that runs them
in order.  In order for your system to run the program correctly, you
will need perl installed on your computer, along with The BLAS (Basic
Linear Algebra Subprograms) shared library.

To run the program, call runHingeProt.pl, along with the name of the
pdb file and the chain id for the file:

==> runHingeProt.pl 4cln.pdb A

The script will create a directory named "4cln.pdb.A", and under this
directory there will be 4 different output files, which are as the following:

- pdbcode.new.hinges: the main output file. gives the rigid parts, and
the hinge residues for the slowest modes 1 and 2, seperately.

- pdbcode.mode1.pdb: the output of the motion in the first slowest
  mode. 11 different models represent different motion extents, 6
  being the initial pdb file supplied. Coloring by temperature will
  show the rigid parts and hinges.

- pdbcode.mode2.pdb: same as above, for the second slowest mode.

- pdbcode.new.loops: includes a list of flexible loops identified by
  the first two modes.
